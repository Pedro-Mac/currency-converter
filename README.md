# Getting Started

## Scripts

- Run `npm build` in order to build the app for production.

## Challenges

- ### Select currency to convert:
  Initially, I tried to use a `select` field to display the options of currencies to convert, only to realize the countless limitatios to that approach, specially with styling. I had to re-do it, now using a radio type input and I was pretty impressed with the outcome. I had never done it and even though I feel like it could have been done better, I did make it and I learned something new once again.
